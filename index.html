      <p>When starting this course, my knowledge of data collection and representation was very minimal. I understood data in a broad sense, but in the way that we had to use it in Writing and Digital Media, I was unsure.
      </p>
  <p> I decided that what I was interested in was the ways that I interacted with "fit-Instagram" pages. To figure out my patterns, I documented the times that I would like, save, like and save, or ignore the posts.</p>

    <h2 class="head2"> <b> Data Visualization </b> </h2>
    <p>I chose to display my data based on which muscle groups the posts I saved the most were. For this, I chose a simple human body with a heat map. The higher the saturation of red, the more saves that were done.</p>
